A simple demo calculator app that operates (+, -, *, /, ^, %) on two numbers using objects from classes.

The app reads two numbers and a choice of operation from the user via an object created from the Scanner class. It then
instantiates an object and populates it's respective attributes. If the inputs are valid, two numbers will be operated 
on and the result printed. Some errors are handled.

This repository is part of an evolving set of repositories (edu-oop-java-*) demonstrating coursework in OOP using Java.
The technologies used are Java, Maven, Git, GitHub and IntelliJ IDEA.
An internal programming style guide is used.
